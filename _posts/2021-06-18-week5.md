title: Week 5 Report
---

Towards the end of the fourth week. I was able to receive some video clips to develop capstions and developed the conditoned captions for it as well from Ramzy. There was a lot of different obsticles that we faced as a team in this week when it comes to developing our experimental study material. These obstacle were mostly on Ramzy's side where his internet has not been consistent or reliable enough for him to create those video clips and uploaded them. In the meantime, I continued to iterate the Metholodoy section of our research and left some parts unknown as we would need more information on before adding. I have continued reading some more articles that Dr. Raja suggesting in our folder and start digesting them to consider where to add within our literature reciew as that will give more infornation and support to our research questions based on emtions and paralingustic infromation in captions.

Towards the end of the week, Ramzy was able to upload four video clips for the first condtion which is using Memoji for displaying emotion information. I have started working on these clips by developing the base captions. I have not finish all four video clips that Ramzy uploaded but that work will continue to next week. When I finish with that, I plan on making the condtioned captions onto the video clips and continue to work on that until Ramzy is able to upload more videos to be worked on!
