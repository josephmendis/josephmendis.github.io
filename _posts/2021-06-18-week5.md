title: Week 5 Report
---

Towards the end of the fourth week. I was able to receive some video clips to develop captions and developed the conditioned captions for it as well from Ramzy. There were a lot of different obstacles that we faced as a team in this week when it comes to developing our experimental study material. These obstacles were mostly on Ramzy's side where his internet has not been consistent or reliable enough for him to create those video clips and uploaded them. In the meantime, I continued to iterate the Methodology section of our research and left some parts unknown as we would need more information before adding. I have continued reading some more articles that Dr. Raja suggesting in our folder and start digesting them to consider where to add within our literature review as that will give more information and support to our research questions based on emotions and paralinguistic information in captions.

Towards the end of the week, Ramzy was able to upload four video clips for the first condition which is using Memoji for displaying emotional information. I have started working on these clips by developing the base captions. I have not finished all four video clips that Ramzy uploaded but that work will continue next week. When I finish with that, I plan on making the conditioned captions onto the video clips and continue to work on that until Ramzy is able to upload more videos to be worked on!
