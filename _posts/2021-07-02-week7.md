title: Week 7 Report
---

This week was another slow week as this was the week where our team has been waiting on our IRB approval for us to be able to start recruiting participants for our study and start collecting data. In between this week, we took the time revising other components that we already developed to pass the time while waiting for the IRB approval. We looked back at the methodology section of our paper to add some revisions and more content. We as well made some further tweaks and modifications to our surveys and finalized all the details to be ready for the real participant testing. Towards the end of the week, we had another pilot study with Sam Sit and this helped us finalize and make some minor corrections to the study. While we were waiting. Ramzy and I discussed how the flyer could be improved to make it feel more engaging for our audience and Ramzy went ahead and took the initiative to revise the flyer.

Ramzy finished the flyer around Wednesday and it was around that time where our IRB protocol got approved! We went out and proceed to start recruiting. I posted the flyer on my social media and within one to two days I have received around 8 participants who are interested. Two of them already worked out a time to meet by using when2meet, while the other I have not heard a response back! Looking forward to starting collecting data after our week-long break and continuing recruiting and sending out emails!
